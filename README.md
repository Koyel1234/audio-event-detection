# audio-event-detection
This repo contains python code and some excel files for project <b>Audio Event Detection</b>, a course project for second semester elective course <b>Advanced Topics in Machine Learning</b> (EE698R), at IITK. I am <b>not attaching</b> here the UrbanSound8K dataset (which has been used in the project) <b>due to some permission issue</b>. You can find UrbanSound8K dataset simply by googling its name. You need to fill up a form available on the same place from where you are going to download the dataset before getting the dataset.

In this project, given two sounds to our model, our model can identify some another sound is similar to any one of given two sounds or not.
